<h1>Early Life </h1>
<h2> Pusarla lives in Hyderabad, Telangana. She was educated at Auxilium High School, Hyderabad and at St. Ann's College for Women, Hyderabad. Though her parents played professional volleyball, Pusarla chose badminton over it because she drew inspiration from the success of Pullela Gopichand, the 2001 All England Open Badminton Champion. She eventually started playing badminton from the age of eight.Pusarla first learned the basics of the sport with the guidance of Mehboob Ali at the badminton courts of Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications in Secunderabad. Soon after, she joined Pullela Gopichand's Gopichand Badminton Academy. While profiling Pusarla's career, a correspondent with The Hindu wrote "The fact that she reports on time at the coaching camps daily, traveling a distance of 56 km from her residence, is perhaps a reflection of her willingness to complete her desire to be a good badminton player with the required hard work and commitment."</h2><br><br><br>


<h2>Saina Nehwal, the daughter of Harvir Singh Nehwal and Usha Rani Nehwal, was born in Hisar.She has only one sibling, an elder sister named Chandranshu Nehwal. Her father, who has a PhD in agricultural science,worked at Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University. She completed her first few years of schooling at Campus School CCS HAU, Hisar.She finished 12th grade from the St. Ann's College for Women, Hyderabad. When her father was promoted and transferred from Haryana to Hyderabad, she took up badminton at the age of eight to express herself as she did not know the local language well enough to socialise with other kids. Her parents played badminton for a number of years. Her mother, Usha Rani, was a state level badminton player in Haryana.Nehwal took up badminton to fulfill her mother's dream of becoming a national level badminton player, while her sister played volleyball. Her father, who was among the top players in the university circuit, used his provident fund to invest in good badminton training for her. Nehwal also has a brown belt in karate. She and her family still speak the Haryanvi language at home. She is a fan of Shah Rukh Khan and Prabhas. She is in the process of opening a badminton academy in her native state of Haryana.</h2>

<h2> Born to Uday Shankar and Subhadra of Guntur, as an 11-year-old, Kashyap Parupalli first enrolled with a training camp conducted by S. M. Arif in Hyderabad, India. Because his father had a transferable job, their family kept moving frequently. While in Bangalore, he joined the Padukone Academy. In 2004, they moved back to Hyderabad. Soon after, Kashyap was diagnosed with asthma after a few medical tests. Kashyap felt that his stay in Bangalore during 2000â€“03 might have aggravated the condition. Though the diagnosis came as a shock to him and he thought that his playing career was finished, he put in a lot of effort with determination to overcome the problem.Using appropriate medication, his condition began to improve dramatically. He continued his training at the Gopichand Academy under Pullela Gopichand, a former All England Open champion.</h2>

<h2>Pullela Gopichand was born on 16 November 1973 to Pullela Subash Chandra and, Prakasam district, Andhra Pradesh.
